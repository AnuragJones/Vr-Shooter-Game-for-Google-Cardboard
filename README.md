# Vr-Shooter-Game-for-Google-Cardboard

Unity Vr Shooetr Game for Google cardboard. This project is an Virtual Reality project that shows a a bunch of targets (also called the enemies in the game) which the "Player" has to shoot/attack to survive and gain points. If the "Player" fails to hit even a single target/enemy, the player dies and the game ends. The game is made completely through unity and c# scripts edited in visual studio. The Targets have been attatched with different materials and shaped to give it variety and the game auido has also been added to make the experience more entertaining. To have a better experience of the game place the phone in a google cardboard for the better virtual reality experience, or else just hold the phone in your hand and play the game as usual.
